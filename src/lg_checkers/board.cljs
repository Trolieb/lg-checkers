; == Notes ==============================================
; Board pieces are defined in the checkers.css file.  The
; currently defined pieces are:
;     :red-piece
;     :black-piece
;     :prom-red-piece
;     :prom-black-piece
;     :empty
;
; The board is laid out as a 32 element map, one element
; for each position.  It is stored in an atom, and bound
; to the UI.  Any update of the atom will cause an UI
; refresh to reflect the current board state.
;
; core.async is used to implement CSP (Communicating
; Sequential Proceses), and channels are used to report
; user interaction events, as well as changing the board
; state.

; ===Channels ===========================================
; the board generates events on this channel
;     {:event :event-symbol
;      :position <int>}
(defonce board-events (chan))

; the board receives commands to manipulate its state
;     {:command :command-symbol

;      :piece :piece-symbol}

; for other processes to acquire the board state atom
;     (atom (create-board))
(defonce board-state (chan))

; piece in it.
